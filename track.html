    <h2>The Veledrome</h2>

    <p>A velodrome is an arena for track cycling. Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, consisting of two 180-degree circular bends connected by two straights. The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate easement curve.</p>
    <p>The first velodromes were constructed during the mid-late 19th century. Some were purpose-built just for cycling, and others were built as part of facilities for other sports; many were built around athletics tracks or other grounds and any banking was shallow. Early surfaces included cinders or shale, though concrete, asphalt and tarmac later became more common.</p>
    <h2 style="clear:both">Track Bikes</h2>
    <p>A track bike is optimized for racing at a velodrome or outdoor track. Unlike road bicycles, the track bike only a single gear and has neither a freewheel nor brakes. Tires are narrow and inflated to high pressure to reduce rolling resistance.</p>
